        <p>Although Khloé Kardashian believes in aliens, she does not appreciate being compared to one. The reality tv star took social media to clap back at a troll who disrespected her and said hateful comments about her looks. “Does research indicate that the more plastic surgery someone has, the more likely they are to suffer from migraines? What kind of pharmaceutical company chooses someone who has had so much plastic surgery they look like an alien, as their spokesperson?” the troll wrote, referring to Kardashian’s recent partnership with a migraine medicine.

           “Sorry you feel that way. You have every right to block/mute me. I am trying to help many out there who suffer in silence. You're completely entitled to your opinions,” the mom of one replied. ”Just as I am mine. I don’t think you should refer to yourself as a feminist if you are attacking a woman unprovoked.”
